News: We moved all our stuff to a server in the USofA since hosting that kind of tools in Germany could lead to pretty much unwanted consequences. Stay tuned and visit http://h4k.in/encoding as often as possible. We can't really find words to thank or provider so let's just say: damn - you took a freaking bunch of concerns off our shoulders!

And yes - we are still the PHPIDS Team
